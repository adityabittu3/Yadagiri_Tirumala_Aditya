"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance.

"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies.

"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring.

"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less.

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance.

"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies.

"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring.

"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less.

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance.

"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies.

"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring.

"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less.

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance.

"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies.

"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring.

"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less.

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance.

"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies.

"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring.

"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less.

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating.

"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through.

The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story. Just drawn out.",this good movie could told hour le the material grim i guess thats part story tellingi cant understand couldnt done hour the plot didnt warrant acting almost held but could see goingthe court sequence way long muddled nature story is historical account happened poor people is story duplicity relationship is greed human nature is psychopath or court room dramafor would didnt drag unnecessarily great acting great story just drawn
"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones.

"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene

But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths?

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed. Not a terrible flick, merely a tedious one and that's a huge pity when you have such talent and money available with the potential to make something truly great...Thank you for reading my 2100 th review on Imdb !",the good brilliant actor leonardo di caprio robert deniro acting quite well not extraordinary well really deliver solid performance it always joy watch performthe bad movie last way too long come hour minute beware aint gripping masterpiece aint fastpaced spectacle aint visceral drama it merely slowburning portrait already wearing patience thin half hourthe first minute story get see nothing else money hungry men marying indian woman land rich oil married slowly poison indian wife altered medicine make terminally ill and die oil rich land copy repeat on plot may sound vicious intrigueing oppositehow director martin scorsese manage ruin devestating story by simply not restraining time and injecting true drama thrill it toddles along only hour pace take spark punch experiencedthere fault martin scorsese direction his choice editing photography soundscore usual level quality directing not terrible quite average martin scorsese movie used wild dangerous fast none seen killer flower moondisappointed not terrible flick merely tedious one thats huge pity talent money available potential make something truly greatthank reading th review imdb
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told. While I don't have a strong urge to watch it again, I'm glad I had the chance to see it.07/10.",im diehard martin scorsese fan i deep appreciation movie others dont quite resonate this particular film fell somewhere middle meconsidering extensive threehour runtime pacing held well i never found bored though i cant say i thoroughly thrilled either there moment seemed like conversation lacked significant impact narrative the movie truly hit stride final third tension escalates significantlythe acting across board outstanding especially lead cast dicaprio de niro always delivered great performance ive become fan lily gladstone the visual set design also topnotchi believe important story skillfully told while i dont strong urge watch im glad i chance see
"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked.

"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit. This is not Scorsese's best work and it doesn't deserve such high praise.",this movie longer two hour the scene film formulaic there repetitiveness scene showing lily gladstone sick dicaprio giving insulin de niro plotting someone death this repetitiveness made film long there seemed build kind turn event audience already fed whole story there isnt real climax time story get away repetitive build ending total let the ending predictable worth wait take get therethe acting fine character interesting lily gladstone character actually personality pretty much bed ridden whole film the rest character didnt provide anything make standoutthe execution story made film weak it dialogue heavy action scene even dialogue never feel dramatic intense it end leaving one feeling indifferent defeat purpose telling story impacted whole group peoplethis film highly overrated consider simple story entertainment value provides it small piece history told unemotional way possible not film i would care ever revisit this scorsese best work doesnt deserve high praise
"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw?I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",this fifth martin scorsese movie i expecting like since i likedloved work my verdict yes i really like one i note cinema i watched pretty bad sound system time i couldnt hear character whispering so i might rate even higher future rewatch hopefully apple tv soonkillers flower moon based book based true forgotten story osage nation sall cast member really great understatement this first i see lily gladstone shes superb leonardo di caprio favorite movie top game well robert de niro unsurprisingly amazing despite threehour run story feel wellpaced doesnt really drag much the story also really distressing part well might brutal film yet i really can not forget scene still stuck mind still make feel bit emotional i also love minimal use score make thing feel morei dunnorawi also love ending creative i highly recommend watch
"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
"The good: 2 brilliant actors, Leonardo Di Caprio and Robert DeNiro acting quite well. Not extraordinary well, but they really deliver solid performances. It's always a joy to watch them perform.The bad: this movie LASTS WAY TOO LONG. Come on, 3 hours and 20 minutes! BEWARE: this aint no gripping masterpiece, this aint no fastpaced spectacle, this aint no visceral drama. It's merely a SLOWburning portrait, which was already wearing my patience thin after half an hour...The first 90 minutes into the story we get to see nothing else but money hungry men, marying Indian women for their land (rich on oil) and then (once married) slowly poison those Indian wives with an altered ""medicine"" which makes them terminally ill. And when they die, they own their oil rich land. Copy repeat. On and on the same plot. May sound vicious and intrigueing, but it was the opposite.How did director Martin Scorsese manage to ruin such a devestating story? By simply NOT restraining himself in time. And by not injecting any TRUE drama or thrill. It just toddles along. Only after 2 hours, the pace takes up and there is some spark and punch to be experienced.There are more faults with Martin Scorsese's direction. His choice of editing, photography, soundscore, are all below his usual level of quality of directing. Not terrible, but quite average. Martin Scorsese's movies used to be wild and dangerous and fast. None of that is to be seen in Killers of the Flower Moon.Disappointed.

"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.",killer flower moon western crime drama film cowritten directed martin

"Leonardo Di Caprio returns from World War One to Oklahoma, where oil has made the Osage Indians rich. After long, meandering talks with his uncle, Robert De Niro, Di Caprio runs a taxi, and picks up Lily Gladstone, a pure-blood Osage, and begins to drive her regularly. They fall in love, and eventually have three children, while someone is busy killing off Osage Indians.This being a Scorsese movie with a stellar cast, it is impeccably written, directed, and shot. I don't know what Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time editor, was doing. At more than three hours before he wraps it up with a ten-minute epilogue, presented as an episode of Gangbusters talking about where everyone wound up spending the rest of their lives. It goes on too long for a movie, at least for a movie without a break. This is the upside and downside of companies like Amazon and Netflix having the wherewithal to tempt great film makers with large gobs of money. Because the viewer at home will watch a movie like this at his leisure, taking time to go to the bath room, having a meal, and so forth, it's made for him. There is no need to edit this down. What could have been cut to a reasonable length without DiCaprio's army career and finding out that he lived in a trailer in his final years is left in, with only the audience's bladders telling them it's time to leave this story. What would have made a fine mini-series on television must be watched in one go in the movie theater, trapped between the gorgeous images, and the fact that every minute of screen time cuts two points off the IQ of DiCaprio's character.It's a movie that really should be seen in the theater for the size and audience, and yet makes it impossible.",leonardo di caprio return world war one oklahoma oil made osage indian rich after long meandering talk uncle robert de niro di caprio run taxi pick lily gladstone pureblood osage begin drive regularly they fall love eventually three child someone busy killing osage indiansthis scorsese movie stellar cast impeccably written directed shot i dont know thelma schoonmaker scorsese longtime editor at three hour wrap tenminute epilogue presented episode gangbusters talking everyone wound spending rest life it go long movie least movie without break this upside downside company like amazon netflix wherewithal tempt great film maker large gob money because viewer home watch movie like leisure taking time go bath room meal forth made there need edit what could cut reasonable length without dicaprios army career finding lived trailer final year left audience bladder telling time leave story what would made fine miniseries television must watched one go movie theater trapped gorgeous image fact every minute screen time cut two point iq dicaprios characterits movie really seen theater size audience yet make impossible
"Oil is discovered under Osage Nation land in late 19th century Oklahoma. It's 1919. The oil companies have moved in and Osage people are some of the richest folks in the world. All that wealth attracts a lot of workers, capitalists, criminals, and general scammers. Everybody is looking to get a piece of the Indian oil pie. War veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leo DiCaprio) returns to join his brother Byron and his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro). William has become a wealthy leader of the town by having his family and friends worm their way into the native community. He is known as King Hale and has ingratiated himself into the tribe. He directs Ernest to woo and marry Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a shy and sickly native woman.I put off watching this for as long as possible. I don't want to spend three hours watching evil people stealing from helpless Indian folks. As I started watching this, a phrase pops into my mind. This is ""stealing candy from a baby"" and it's not a fun time to watch it over and over again. It's a tough watch for two hours. I find myself stopping or just multi-tasking with my iPad. When the FBI shows up, this becomes a tradition howcatchem and that's a little bit more watchable. I don't have to stop anymore. This would be a great two hour mystery movie with the FBI. Martin Scorsese probably wants the native characters to have more time. He is not shy about making these characters evil. Leo is doing something like Brando and I don't like it. It seems much more fitting that he be handsome Leo so that Mollie would be powerless to his charms. As for Mollie, her cluelessness is rather frustrating. There is no denying Scorsese's filmmaking mastery or his sincere intentions. The first two hours are a grind, but it is still a rewarding watch.",oil discovered osage nation land late th century oklahoma it the oil company moved osage people richest folk world all wealth attracts lot worker capitalist criminal general scammer everybody looking get piece indian oil pie war veteran ernest burkhart leo dicaprio return join brother byron uncle william hale robert de niro william become wealthy leader town family friend worm way native community he known king hale ingratiated tribe he directs ernest woo marry mollie lily gladstone shy sickly native womani put watching long possible i dont want spend three hour watching evil people stealing helpless indian folk a i started watching phrase pop mind this stealing candy baby fun time watch it tough watch two hour i find stopping multitasking ipad when fbi show becomes tradition howcatchem thats little bit watchable i dont stop anymore this would great two hour mystery movie fbi martin scorsese probably want native character time he shy making character evil leo something like brando i dont like it seems much fitting handsome leo mollie would powerless charm a mollie cluelessness rather frustrating there denying scorsese filmmaking mastery sincere intention the first two hour grind still rewarding watch
"Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.",some film warrant long runtimes

"Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.",martin scorsese follows sloppy the irishman another excursion indulgence overnarration for three half hour tell story osage indian murder osage county oklahoma beginning th century cinematic work visual retelling literature the narrative unfocused longwinded loquacious watching movie like listening busker going repetitiously hour end and story although fascinating enough historical context unappealing revisionist whiff often reduced simple usandthem dichotomy scorsese keep pounding narrative drum like aforementioned busker the killer flower moon never becomes grandiose epic drama purport desperately lack subtlety the performance could good tighter focused movie de niro onto something unique ageing selfrighteous patriarch william hale
"Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.",obviously isnt bad it amazing director interesting story now thats way this worst way tell story it pov fbi thats thing got interesting telling story chronological order wasnt interesting it would better hear investigate info waiting discovered in order random thing happen along story didnt deserve much timefollowing leo wasnt interesting enough hold two hour wa supposed heart breaking sad i dont know but wasnt enough going fill plot the fbi get team looked cool it would much shocking hear murder really driven point home instead kinda experiencing itit slow too slow i worried hour i didnt realize going feel like the irishman slow movie isnt boring and movie boring it slow boring i kept waiting get going never the slow pacing disadvantage movie made lose interest and made much aware length i kept thinking much longer going i think kept shooting ran film
"I'm not a die-hard Martin Scorsese fan. I have a deep appreciation for some of his movies, while others don't quite resonate with me. This particular film fell somewhere in the middle for me.Considering its extensive three-hour runtime, the pacing held up well. I never found myself bored, though I can't say I was thoroughly thrilled either. There were moments when it seemed like some of the conversations lacked significant impact on the narrative. The movie truly hits its stride in the final third, where the tension escalates significantly.The acting across the board was outstanding, especially from the lead cast. DiCaprio and De Niro, as always, delivered great performances, and I've become a fan of Lily Gladstone. The visual and set design were also top-notch.I believe it's an important story, and it's skillfully told.

"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",first thing first there absolutely need ½ hour long it follows story ambitious ernest leonardo dicaprio arrives osage home venal uncle king robert de niro encourages ingratiate wealthy indigenous population he end meeting driving independent nononsense mollie lily gladstone start fall charismatic charm fall love marry though love wife ernest prof rather fickle violent man love money behest outwardly benign relative start implement scheme ensure right oil well head move swiftly frequently brutally suitable owner this sudden spate accident killing prudent action fearful local council alert authority washington despatch team fbi agent led tenacious white jesse plemons get bottom thing perhaps king house card might becoming precarious dicaprio effective he play well man juggle internal demon conflict cleverly manipulated onform slightly menacing de niro it gladstone steal show though she play role decent loving shrewd savvy mollie strongly a start become victim husband avarice exudes sense desperation pleading dignified struggle potently illustrative far white man prepared go get keep money the film beautifully shot plausible look help generate audience true sense outwardly genteel civilised society really anything writing clearly interweaves clandestine aspect plot noble one perhaps sacrilegious say though time really drag i felt could easily lost hour condensed story immersed u quickly characterisation really suffered it good film great film unlike scorsese far better irishman im sure i rush watch
"Well that was a real snorer.Scorsese took a taut thriller of a book, detailing a horrific crime against the Osage tribe of Oklahoma, and turned it into a boring history lesson 2 hours too long. I almost fell asleep twice.Moreover, he significantly changed the facts of how the bad guys were sniffed out. In reality, J. Edgar Hoover's Texas Ranger, Tom White, went undercover, at significant risk to his life, to root out the evil mastermind and his henchmen.Why screw with a masterpiece of writing? This could have been a nail-biting thriller exposing a terrible episode in American history. The decision to dumb down the actual suspense of the situation was a poor one. Sadly, this film will bypass generations of moviegoers who should have been given a film to watch and rewatch.Go read the book instead.",well real snorerscorsese took taut thriller book detailing horrific crime osage tribe oklahoma turned boring history lesson hour long i almost fell asleep twicemoreover significantly changed fact bad guy sniffed in reality j edgar hoover texas ranger tom white went undercover significant risk life root evil mastermind henchmenwhy screw masterpiece writing this could nailbiting thriller exposing terrible episode american history the decision dumb actual suspense situation poor one sadly film bypass generation moviegoer given film watch rewatchgo read book instead
"Greetings again from the darkness. Read the book and see the movie. The order doesn't much matter, as David Grann's best-selling non-fiction novel is an incredibly emotional read, while Martin Scorsese's film is an example of elevated filmmaking. Of course, it's understandable if a book detailing a repulsive historic travesty is not your cup of tea, or if a three-and-a-half-hour movie on the same subject holds no appeal for you. However, if you are up for the challenge, both are extraordinary works of art, though surprisingly, quite different experiences.Oscar winner Scorsese worked on the script adapting Grann's novel with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth (FORREST GUMP, 1994), and Scorsese has stated Leonardo DiCaprio encouraged some changes in perspective. Scorsese also spent a great deal of time with Osage folks making sure to gain insight on how to properly tell their story with all due sensitivity and respect. And what a story it is. While reading Grann's book, I remained in a state of disbelief that this tragic story from the 1920's was not common knowledge. In contrast, I felt the telling of this story in the movie, softened the edges just a bit.Oscar winner DiCaprio stars as Ernest Burkhart, a man returning to town after serving in WWI. Ernest is a simple man, and DiCaprio plays him with a SLING BLADE jaw line and a constant state of being a half-step behind goings on. He's not a total sap, but close enough that he can be manipulated. This is especially true when it comes to his rancher Uncle William King Hale played by two-time Oscar winner Robert DeNiro. The two men are related but seemingly share no other characteristics. ""King"" is a master schemer who has spent decades cultivating a relationship and image with the Osage, only to secretly take advantage of their trust at every opportunity. Ernest is a self-described lazy man who 'loves money', though he has little interest in earning it the hard way.There are multiple relationships that are crucial to follow closely. Ernest and his Uncle, Ernest and his Osage wife Mollie (a brilliant Lily Gladstone), Hale and the Osage, Federal investigator Tom White (Jesse Plemons) and everyone to whom he speaks, and then the network of interactions between Ernest and the locals. The long roster of characters jumps in numbers again during the final act, which offers a courtroom drama and interrogations that deliver the conclusion. It's the first act where Scorsese portrays the dramatic shift from the ""old"" Osage culture to their staggering newfound wealth. Of course, at the core of all of this is the despicable scheme used by Hale in a heartless strategy to steal the wealth. For those who haven't yet read the book, it's best if no more of the story is known prior to seeing the movie. One thing that can be disclosed is that this true story proves the exception to ""them with the gold make the rules."" This was also the first case of the newly formed FBI under J Edgar Hoover.As always, Scorsese has assembled a deep supporting cast to complement the stellar leads. A few of those playing key roles include Tantoo Cardinal, Gene Jones (the coin flip clerk in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), John Lithgow, Oscar winner Brendan Fraser, Cara Jade Myers, Jason Isbell, Jillian Dion, Scott Shepherd, William Belleau, Sturgill Simpson, Ty Mitchell, Tommy Schultz, (personal favorite) Barry Corbin, Pete Yorn, and Jack White. With apologies to Jesse Plemons who is solid as Tom White, it's the three leads who captivate us. DiCaprio turns in what is likely his best ever performance, while DeNiro eerily captures the sneaky and devastating evil of Hale (and we get a nod to his Al Capone role from 36 years ago). What can we say about Lily Gladstone? She was a standout in CERTAIN WOMEN (2016), and here she is the heart and soul of the story (though DiCaprio's Ernest gets much more screen time). Her expressive eyes convey so much, even when she speaks no words.In addition to the talented cast, Scorsese's technical group is just as outstanding. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) perfectly balances the vastness of the setting with the intimate moments. Production Designer Jack Fisk (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, 2007) delivers the look and feel of the times, while three-time Oscar winner Thelma Schoonmaker works her magic as an Editor to create a manageable flow of this epic. The film's score, expertly tied to the story's measured pacing, comes from Robbie Robertson (longtime leader of The Band), who passed away soon after. There is a Scorsese cameo, and I left the theater thinking how usual it is to find a movie so ambitious in scale, yet so intimate and searing in its personal moments. Some may find the larger story a bit difficult to grasp, and that's likely due to our humanity and desire to believe in the non-existence of this level of evil.Opens in theaters nationally on October 20, 2023.",greeting darkness read book see movie the order doesnt much matter david granns bestselling nonfiction novel incredibly emotional read martin scorsese film example elevated filmmaking of course understandable book detailing repulsive historic travesty cup tea threeandahalfhour movie subject hold appeal however challenge extraordinary work art though surprisingly quite different experiencesoscar winner scorsese worked script adapting granns novel oscar winning screenwriter eric roth forrest gump scorsese stated leonardo dicaprio encouraged change perspective scorsese also spent great deal time osage folk making sure gain insight properly tell story due sensitivity respect and story while reading granns book i remained state disbelief tragic story common knowledge in contrast i felt telling story movie softened edge bitoscar winner dicaprio star ernest burkhart man returning town serving wwi ernest simple man dicaprio play sling blade jaw line constant state halfstep behind going he total sap close enough manipulated this especially true come rancher uncle william king hale played twotime oscar winner robert deniro the two men related seemingly share characteristic king master schemer spent decade cultivating relationship image osage secretly take advantage trust every opportunity ernest selfdescribed lazy man love money though little interest earning hard waythere multiple relationship crucial follow closely ernest uncle ernest osage wife mollie brilliant lily gladstone hale osage federal investigator tom white jesse plemons everyone speaks network interaction ernest local the long roster character jump number final act offer courtroom drama interrogation deliver conclusion it first act scorsese portrays dramatic shift old osage culture staggering newfound wealth of course core despicable scheme used hale heartless strategy steal wealth for havent yet read book best story known prior seeing movie one thing disclosed true story prof exception gold make rule this also first case newly formed fbi j edgar hooveras always scorsese assembled deep supporting cast complement stellar lead a playing key role include tantoo cardinal gene jones coin flip clerk no country for old men john lithgow oscar winner brendan fraser cara jade myers jason isbell jillian dion scott shepherd william belleau sturgill simpson ty mitchell tommy schultz personal favorite barry corbin pete yorn jack white with apology jesse plemons solid tom white three lead captivate u dicaprio turn likely best ever performance deniro eerily capture sneaky devastating evil hale get nod al capone role year ago what say lily gladstone she standout certain woman heart soul story though dicaprios ernest get much screen time her expressive eye convey much even speaks wordsin addition talented cast scorsese technical group outstanding cinematographer rodrigo prieto brokeback mountain perfectly balance vastness setting intimate moment production designer jack fisk there will be blood delivers look feel time threetime oscar winner thelma schoonmaker work magic editor create manageable flow epic the film score expertly tied story measured pacing come robbie robertson longtime leader the band passed away soon there scorsese cameo i left theater thinking usual find movie ambitious scale yet intimate searing personal moment some may find larger story bit difficult grasp thats likely due humanity desire believe nonexistence level evilopens theater nationally october
"I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.",i strongly recommend reading book film it clear movie simply communicate amount event information book whats wrong i would say movie mostly faithful book except certain chronological order event the problem reading book vastly exciting experience especially event unfolded i dont understand scores decision ditch mystery replace nothing giving away right away who behind we dont even get solid character study since dicaprios character performance onedimensional deniros unfortunately you back forth two character always dynamic even final scene supposed cathartic moment one character felt nothing short underwhelming one good thing i say movie doesnt feel like three half hour although first hour clearly best part rest movie dragging quite bit due repetitive nature choosing tell story perpetrator point view felt like safe choice scorese done much better i might add there several cross cut upshot stylistic choice straight goodfellas rubbed wrong way given nature material a nice visual idea cant breathe life drab screenplay one best part book investigation tom white murder true herculean act scientific evolution method like fingerprint identification whereas movie zap therefore make look like easy catch convict conspiracy behind the book showed dimension government corruption systematic sanctioned murder went way beyond mere individual movie simply failed portray properly the end coda lucky strike radio show another one tame attempt upset audience all reminding similar scene much much better movie the assassination jessie james coward bob ford two brother reenact famous murder theater play i think movie would better hand director like andrew dominic i still commend scoresese putting spotlight important part american history
"Straight up it is a good movie but somehow just feels lacking it multiple places which drags it down. First, the acting by DiCaprio was great and I'm not his biggest fan but after 'Don't Look Up' he once again just pours this emotional effort into scenes he doesn't need to and makes them all elevated which I think helps this movie a lot. Gladstone, De Niro were decent and Plemons wasn't asked to do a whole lot but was fine.Secondly, after seeing Oppenheimer which was a dialogue heavy movie and being gripped from start to finish with the tension building being 10/10 to seeing this and not for one second feeling any tension. As the FBI came knocking I felt I should've been getting itchy for DiCaprio and De Niro but for some reason it just wasn't landing with me. The script was nothing special and I haven't said this for awhile about a movie but it was truly boring. Scenes I could feel like 000o this feels like it's going to escalate here but it doesn't, just keeps this one pace tone the whole way through. The murders just felt so... bleh like it wasn't a big deal and provoked zero emotion from me each time.Lastly, I don't need non-stop action, in fact I don't need any action in a movie to be gripped from go to whoa but the acting and script need to be top tier to do that and this just missed with that. The story would be more interesting if it really did show the bigger picture more and made it feel more impactful, where this just felt like kinda one family with people dying that barely had screen time, that you didn't get to know and therefore care about.Killers Of The Flower Moon is the not masterpiece you expect it to be and is a bit of a slog at times to keep your interest peaked. I'd wait for it to come to Apple TV.",straight good movie somehow feel lacking multiple place drag first acting dicaprio great im biggest fan dont look up pours emotional effort scene doesnt need make elevated i think help movie lot gladstone de niro decent plemons wasnt asked whole lot finesecondly seeing oppenheimer dialogue heavy movie gripped start finish tension building seeing one second feeling tension a fbi came knocking i felt i shouldve getting itchy dicaprio de niro reason wasnt landing the script nothing special i havent said awhile movie truly boring scene i could feel like feel like going escalate doesnt keep one pace tone whole way the murder felt bleh like wasnt big deal provoked zero emotion timelastly i dont need nonstop action fact i dont need action movie gripped go whoa acting script need top tier missed the story would interesting really show bigger picture made feel impactful felt like kinda one family people dying barely screen time didnt get know therefore care aboutkillers of the flower moon masterpiece expect bit slog time keep interest peaked id wait come apple tv
"I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.",i feel like i watched different movie many review i went theater high expectationsthe movie brutally honest story moral bankruptcy corruption decimation tribe hand local landowner only story different typical settler moving west battling tribe it taking land marriage murder inheritance the movie shot well acting top notch working withnow bad desperate need editing hour fine story keep pace move plot pertinent scene this case there least hour drawn scene scene completely irrelevant like random goofy white guy dancing fair almost minute he never seen i felt like story told elderly grandfather would lose pace ramble thing unrelated event taking placethere full conversation native language subtitle it incredibly irritating why dicaprio talk like marble mouth deniro definitely miscast retire time pass period day month year discernible shift let know day passed and sudden shift end format radio show distasteful surreal it left audience anxious leave minute screen darkenedsadly i would recommend movie
"The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.",the story conspiratorial plot kill member osage nation bountiful oil wealth oklahoma one unfamiliar martin scorsese decided make killer of the flower moon three half hour epic impress every technical level flounder thematic emotional one perhaps neglect proper research reading nonfiction book based partially led feeling cold detached disarrayed case resonated way leonardo dicaprio cast jarringly type ernest cowardly quasi wwii vet pressured amoral machiavellian uncle king hale robert de niro marrying wealthy osage woman mollie lily gladstone insinuating lineage oil right get passed along wedlock much film distressing sense audience know exactly sort insidious betrayal happening large everybody region intimate level ernest mollie i saw interview scorsese seemed excited tell story scheming backstabbing psychopathic doublecrossing urban crime saga far wilder rural spatially wide open locale he told interest story woman fatally unforgivably betrayed partner worst way might look like onscreen thematically well seems far interested first part indeed overall tapestry crime clandestine wrongdoing often unnecessarily blunt comedic upheaval fortune well oiled pun intended machine vernacular solidly within wheelhouse it second part intimate picture false marriage unspeakable betrayal consistently shy away exploring sort raw elemental detail unflinching eye emotion required only lily gladstone undeniably give film best performance really task imbuing mollie smouldering ancestral rage elegant angelic poise utterly captivating but shes marooned tempest misguided choice missed opportunity really make story flare alive political clockwork fanfare cloud real chance true poignancy catharsis ive read backstory film scorsese pivoted away original plan tell fbi eventual involvement ultimately sadly little late towards deliberate focus osage plight identity people within tragic turmoil well doesnt really achieve beyond expository newsreel montage roundtable elder discussion admittedly impressive eye costume there scene senior member tribe mention could see enemy would kill seem idea perpetrating atrocity really from narrative standpoint pretty darn clear fact none mollie especially look anywhere close home suspicion simply didnt ring true she well rounded character played beautifully hauntingly gladstone well earned outrage eventual catastrophic corrosion marriage man like ernest rife red flag outset i might add something scorsese frustratingly sidestep stifle outright avoids favour cold procedural i cant help wonder story meant told perspective osage may better edgy esoteric hand
"Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.",visually movie wellshot setting great and i didnt find movie dull hr running time could shaved hour i guess kept shifting tone angle every half hour could worked favour left hoping would sort pay ending climactic conclusion sadly that doesnt happenone big issue film lack hero protagonist could relate the main character ernest villain his wife would hoped would taken heroine role mainly invalid victim entire movie wedding we never get find wealth ran community hale wanted league others since suspicious death happening molly family we never get sense hale coming even family he archetype crime lord getting others work selling cease use dicaprio seemed teetering sling blade territory characterization and know character ernest brother byron also involved never really see act like blood relative there doesnt seem relationship allthen distracting cameo the worst brendan frasers outburst court room i almost forgot movie i watching bad then seem scene bunch supposedly powerful men trying convince ernest right thing pointing greater conspiracy leaving hangingthe end terrible cutting radio program almost destroys atmosphere film preceded it felt cheap trite and scorsese cameo another distraction almost selfservingso i glad terrible incident u history brought light film i dont feel said much took stance a wishy washy effort marty
"I really loved this movie but it simply was way too long. I like long movies, I like slow cinema but there is still the concept of economy or story telling. I wish he would allow himself to ""kill his darlings"" and cut like almost an hour out of this. One of his justifications is that people ""sit and binge tv shows for 4-5 hours"" but it's not at all the same. The form and structure of television and film are completely different, he knows that. It really just feels like self indulgence because he's at the end of his career and nobody is going to tell him no. Self indulgence is the death of a lot of great artist once they find success. Particularly Scorsese, all of his most respected films (maybe with the exception of casino) even if they had a slightly longer run-time were completely trimmed of fat. Every shot, every line has a point in advancing the plot and was very economical. This adaptation felt like it made all the mistakes of adapting from a novel to film. I would absolutely love an edit of this film that is maybe 2 hours long and could easily been done. It would have been more emotionally impactful, interesting and still honored the story and the people it was about. The Osage, which was definitely the most interesting part of the film. But gets swept up in a stale courtroom drama that we've seen a million times and could have been a couple of short scenes.",i really loved movie simply way long i like long movie i like slow cinema still concept economy story telling i wish would allow kill darling cut like almost hour one justification people sit binge tv show hour the form structure television film completely different know it really feel like self indulgence he end career nobody going tell self indulgence death lot great artist find success particularly scorsese respected film maybe exception casino even slightly longer runtime completely trimmed fat every shot every line point advancing plot economical this adaptation felt like made mistake adapting novel film i would absolutely love edit film maybe hour long could easily done it would emotionally impactful interesting still honored story people the osage definitely interesting part film but get swept stale courtroom drama weve seen million time could couple short scene
"This is a very good movie, but it could have been told in an hour less. The material is grim, but I guess that's part of the story telling.I can't understand why this couldn't have been done in 2 hours. The plot didn't warrant it, and the acting almost held it up. But we could all see where this was going.The court sequence was way too long and muddled the nature of the story. Is it an historical account of what happened to these poor people? Is it a story about duplicity in a relationship? Is it about greed and human nature? Is it about psychopaths? Or a court room drama?For me, it would have been an 8/10 if it didn't drag on unnecessarily. Great acting. Great story.

"This movie should not have been longer than two hours. The scenes in the film are formulaic. There was a repetitiveness between scenes showing Lily Gladstone being sick, DiCaprio giving insulin, and De Niro plotting someone's death. This repetitiveness is what made this film so long. There seemed to be a build up for some kind of turn of events but the audience has already been fed the whole story. There isn't a real climax because by the time the story gets away from its repetitive build up the ending is a total let down. The ending is predictable and not worth the wait it takes to get there.The acting is fine but the characters are not that interesting. Lily Gladstone was about the only character that actually had some personality and she was pretty much bed ridden the whole film. The rest of the characters didn't provide anything to make them standout.The execution of the story is what made this film so weak. It is dialogue heavy with a few action scenes but even with all its dialogue it never feels dramatic or intense. It all ends leaving one feeling indifferent and that defeats the purpose of telling such a story that impacted a whole group of people.This film is highly overrated when you consider its simple story and the entertainment value it provides. It's a small piece of history that is told in the most unemotional way possible. Not a film that I would care to ever revisit.

"I am really bummed about how this one turned out. I love the very politically, morally, and racially charged story. I love Eric Roth, I think he's a living legend screenwriter. I loved DiCaprio and Gladstone, they were both brilliant and had beautiful chemistry together. DiCaprio's character is really interesting, he kind of reminds me of the murderer from Act of Killing. Just so dumb he doesn't realize what a monster he is.But this freaking movie is too long and a big mess. The first two hours are very repetitive, and I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters, and who was who, and who was supposed to be murdering who, and for what reason exactly. When Jesse Plemons shows up it does pick up finally, but by then I was so overwhelmed and fatigued that I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked.Also, oddly enough I noticed the sound was TERRIBLE in some scenes. Really crappy dialogue recording. Very surprising.Anyway, I might read the book now, cause the story seems really compelling but I don't think they really did it enough justice here.",i really bummed one turned i love politically morally racially charged story i love eric roth i think he living legend screenwriter i loved dicaprio gladstone brilliant beautiful chemistry together dicaprios character really interesting kind reminds murderer act killing just dumb doesnt realize monster isbut freaking movie long big mess the first two hour repetitive i hard time keeping track character supposed murdering reason exactly when jesse plemons show pick finally i overwhelmed fatigued i didnt enjoy much id likedalso oddly enough i noticed sound terrible scene really crappy dialogue recording very surprisinganyway i might read book cause story seems really compelling i dont think really enough justice
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is getting rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. People are hailing this movie as one of Martin Scorsese's best films, with standout performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. ""Masterpiece"" and ""a sprawling crime epic"" are just a few of the praises ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is receiving, and as a fan of Scorsese's work myself, I was beyond excited as I headed down to the theatre opening night to go watch this movie. And to be quite honest, I wasn't as big a fan of this film as I thought I was going to be.""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" admittedly, follows a group of criminals as they engage in said criminal behavior, a common trait of many Scorsese films. Where this movie differs, however, is in the way it handles the material. In stark contrast to other films of a similar genre, ""Flower Moon"" makes little to no effort to have its audience sympathize with its villainous protagonists. On one hand, this is appreciated, as the protagonists are truly some of the worst, most evil people ever to grace the silver screen. On the other hand, this lack of characterization makes for one-note characters that start and end the movie in the exact same emotional headspace. And maybe that's how everything happened in real life, but for a film, I would've appreciated a little bit of nuance or dramatic heft.As characters engage in their killing spree, you'd be hard-pressed to find any of them undergoing any type of moral quandary or emotional turbulence, or really any type of second guessing as to the morality of their actions. And again, perhaps in real life every single murderer just happened to be a cold-blooded psychopath with zero sense of remorse, but for the sake of the film, it would've been nice to see at least one person question their actions. But because you don't get that, everything feels surprisingly dry even as the scale of the killings increase; the perpetrators are consistently aloof to the destruction they're leaving in their wake, to the point where, eventually, the movie started to get kind of boring.While Scorsese always brings a sheen of professionalism to his films, I also found ""Flower Moon"" to lack the cinematic feel of his previous movies. Something about this movie just felt cheap, despite the $200 million budget. The editing was also jarring at times, lacking coherency, just making the entire movie feel more like a direct-to-video release than a theatrical one. And when it comes to the ending of this movie, whoah man. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that Scorsese pulls a move directly out of Wes Anderson's playbook with an epilogue that is, simply put, ridiculous, almost as if they didn't really know how they should end the film.Overall, I was disappointed by this movie, and didn't find much to like. I will say that the length - practically a 3 hour and 30 minute runtime - wasn't a problem for me. The problem, for me, was in the lack of characterization and one-note performances throughout. Will you enjoy this movie? There is a strong possibility you will, considering I seem to be in the minority; however, my recommendation would be to temper your expectations, and be prepared to take a bathroom break or two.",killer flower moon getting rave review critic audience alike people hailing movie one martin scorsese best film standout performance leonardo dicaprio robert de niro masterpiece sprawling crime epic praise killer flower moon receiving fan scorsese work i beyond excited i headed theatre opening night go watch movie and quite honest i wasnt big fan film i thought i going bekillers flower moon admittedly follows group criminal engage said criminal behavior common trait many scorsese film where movie differs however way handle material in stark contrast film similar genre flower moon make little effort audience sympathize villainous protagonist on one hand appreciated protagonist truly worst evil people ever grace silver screen on hand lack characterization make onenote character start end movie exact emotional headspace and maybe thats everything happened real life film i wouldve appreciated little bit nuance dramatic heftas character engage killing spree youd hardpressed find undergoing type moral quandary emotional turbulence really type second guessing morality action and perhaps real life every single murderer happened coldblooded psychopath zero sense remorse sake film wouldve nice see least one person question action but dont get everything feel surprisingly dry even scale killing increase perpetrator consistently aloof destruction theyre leaving wake point eventually movie started get kind boringwhile scorsese always brings sheen professionalism film i also found flower moon lack cinematic feel previous movie something movie felt cheap despite million budget the editing also jarring time lacking coherency making entire movie feel like directtovideo release theatrical one and come ending movie whoah man i wont spoil anything let say scorsese pull move directly wes anderson playbook epilogue simply put ridiculous almost didnt really know end filmoverall i disappointed movie didnt find much like i say length practically hour minute runtime wasnt problem the problem lack characterization onenote performance throughout will enjoy movie there strong possibility considering i seem minority however recommendation would temper expectation prepared take bathroom break two
"This is my fifth??? Martin Scorsese movie, so I was expecting to like it since I liked/loved most of his other works. My verdict: yes, I really like this one too. I have to note that the cinema I watched it in had a pretty bad sound system and a few times I couldn't hear characters whispering. So I might rate this even higher on a future rewatch, hopefully on Apple TV soon.Killers of the Flower Moon is based on a book, which is based on a true and forgotten story of the Osage Nation in the 1920s.All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet.

"After seeing the trailers , I couldn't help but look forward to this. On paper it has everything. Aside from the performances which will clean up at the Oscars along with best picture, director, score, costume etc etc , I came out feeling flat, bored and relieved it had finished. The running time is ridiculously long and could easily have been 90 minutes shorter. It just plods along, with no surprises or tension. It tells an important story in American history but I've watched documentaries that hold my attention more. Martin Scorsese has recent history in long features and where something like Oppenheimer's similar running time flew by, this was tough to get through....... Can you imagine the directors cut.......",after seeing trailer i couldnt help look forward on paper everything aside performance clean oscar along best picture director score costume etc etc i came feeling flat bored relieved finished the running time ridiculously long could easily minute shorter it plod along surprise tension it tell important story american history ive watched documentary hold attention martin scorsese recent history long feature something like oppenheimer similar running time flew tough get can imagine director cut
"Not the masterpiece I was expecting mainly because the leisurely pace overshadows all the good qualities. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a tragic nonfiction murder tale that I was really looking forward to. My expectations were high, especially after Martin Scorsese's passionate rants about what qualifies as cinema. From a technical standpoint, almost every aspect of the movie was excellent. The visuals were stunning, the story had good intentions and emotional depth, the dialogue was well-crafted, and the acting was top-notch. Lily Gladstone truly shone in a cast that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, so it should have been a great film, right? However, there was absolutely no reason for it to be 3 hours and 30 minutes long. It felt like a real chore to sit through.The movie had a slow pace, which would have been fine if it were around 2 hours long, but for a nearly 4-hour runtime, it simply wasn't engaging enough. I know that film enthusiasts and Scorsese fans who believe superheroes ruined cinema will likely praise this film, but as a regular moviegoer, it didn't resonate with me as much. Some people even walked out during the screening, but I stayed, hoping the movie would pick up later on. It got to the point where cinema staff had to wake up some people after it ended. The movie could have easily conveyed the same emotional depth and told the entire story in just 2 hours.DiCaprio plays a villain, and although the extent of his villainy is slowly revealed in parts, De Niro is the mastermind behind the plot. There is some humor, the kind that might be frowned upon today but was likely just everyday conversation in the 1920s. The film had selective subtitles, and while more subtitles would have been helpful, maybe they didn't add much context to those scenes.The movie lacked liveliness, high points, and because of that, it failed to engage the audience. While Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone were standout performers, I mostly remember DiCaprio for how much he frowned, second only to Karl Urban in ""Dredd."" I wasn't expecting to see a spanking scene either. The rest of the cast's performances were decent but not particularly memorable.The film felt flat, with no real climaxes or peaks. It likely rides on the reputation of the big names associated with it. It's a profoundly emotional and tragic story, but the movie's extended runtime and lack of engagement overshadow the sadness and brutality of the narrative.",not masterpiece i expecting mainly leisurely pace overshadows good quality killer flower moon tragic nonfiction murder tale i really looking forward my expectation high especially martin scorsese passionate rant qualifies cinema from technical standpoint almost every aspect movie excellent the visuals stunning story good intention emotional depth dialogue wellcrafted acting topnotch lily gladstone truly shone cast included leonardo dicaprio robert de niro great film right however absolutely reason hour minute long it felt like real chore sit throughthe movie slow pace would fine around hour long nearly hour runtime simply wasnt engaging enough i know film enthusiast scorsese fan believe superheroes ruined cinema likely praise film regular moviegoer didnt resonate much some people even walked screening i stayed hoping movie would pick later it got point cinema staff wake people ended the movie could easily conveyed emotional depth told entire story hoursdicaprio play villain although extent villainy slowly revealed part de niro mastermind behind plot there humor kind might frowned upon today likely everyday conversation the film selective subtitle subtitle would helpful maybe didnt add much context scenesthe movie lacked liveliness high point failed engage audience while leonardo dicaprio lily gladstone standout performer i mostly remember dicaprio much frowned second karl urban dredd i wasnt expecting see spanking scene either the rest cast performance decent particularly memorablethe film felt flat real climax peak it likely ride reputation big name associated it profoundly emotional tragic story movie extended runtime lack engagement overshadow sadness brutality narrative
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a drag. There is a large absence of tension and drama in the story that really sabotages the pace of the entire film. Zero urgency in the characters motives nor any sense of depth to them. Everyone acts great, (obviously) but even they can't save it from the dull numbing dialogue and lack of story direction.I don't have a problem with long movies. I don't need constant action and mayhem to keep my attention. I loved the Irishman and that was the same running time. But this felt like an eternity to get through. Nothing happens and when something does, it's underwhelming and hazy. The story is repetitive and never truly kicks things off to keep your attention. I felt things weren't explained clearly nor entertaining. It just all felt so bland and hollow. The movie sleepwalks start to finish.Breaks my heart to write this about my hero. He's the best filmmaker working today. I absolutely love the guy and his work has impacted my life tremendously. But this was a painful sit. There are good scenes to be enjoyed but its far and few in between. The biggest positive about this movie is it's the first time I've seen Robert De Niro truly act in the past 20 years.",killer flower moon drag there large absence tension drama story really sabotage pace entire film zero urgency character motif sense depth everyone act great obviously even cant save dull numbing dialogue lack story directioni dont problem long movie i dont need constant action mayhem keep attention i loved irishman running time but felt like eternity get nothing happens something underwhelming hazy the story repetitive never truly kick thing keep attention i felt thing werent explained clearly entertaining it felt bland hollow the movie sleepwalks start finishbreaks heart write hero he best filmmaker working today i absolutely love guy work impacted life tremendously but painful sit there good scene enjoyed far the biggest positive movie first time ive seen robert de niro truly act past year
